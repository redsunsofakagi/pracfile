I saw her the first time
In the background of
a photo, a friend has sent
and a cold heart felt... 
Something.
That day.

That friend introduced us soon after
At school, we were acquainted
And i couldn't stop thinking
About her.
Just... Her.

Mild pink and roses
The freshness of lemon
And the mystery of one hidden in the dark.
In felt like i knew her
another life, another death
we had been together.

And we were, once again.
And it was time to know one another.
Again.
And so, we did. 

On a fateful night, she held me.
She held me by my waist
In a tight embrace 
And 
I couldn't help but look
Into her eyes

And i saw a mirror.
And we saw each other. 
And i saw her again
And i knew her again.
All over again.

I art thou, she said.
Thou art I, i said.
Mild pink and roses.
Vibrant and grey.

But she was running
out of time 
and away.
And she said, goodbye.
...But it didn't have to be.
Yet it was. 

I'll see you soon, i said.
She smiled.
She never left.
